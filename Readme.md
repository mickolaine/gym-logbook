# Gym Logbook
## Sailfish application to log gym exercise progression

Gym Logbook (name in development) is a Sailfish app developed for Jolla phone
to log and plan gym exercise progress.

At the moment program does not work. It's still in early development phase.

List of planned (and done) features:

- Add exercises, eg. Bench press or Squat (Done)
- Add "sets" to exercises, eg. 3 sets of 5 repetitions with 60 kg at specified date (Done mostly)
- Plan ahead progress. Not just adding sets with future dates but also some automations such as
  Wendler's 5/3/1 calculator that adds whole month of sets at once.
- Add workouts. eg. "Monday" which includes exercises "Bench press, Chinups, Bent over row, ..."
- 1RM calculator which estimates your maximum from sets with "Done" status
